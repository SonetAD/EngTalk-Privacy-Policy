    <h2 id="data-deletion">11. Data Deletion Without Account Removal</h2>
    <p>
      At EngTalk, we value your control over your data. We provide options to
      delete specific content without requiring complete account removal.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Voice Bites:</strong> Each voice bite you upload appears as a
        card within your profile or on the explore page. To delete a voice bite,
        simply tap the trash icon located on the card. This will immediately and
        permanently remove the recording from our servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Messages:</strong> To delete a chat message, long-press the
        message bubble. A delete option will appear, allowing you to remove that
        message from our servers permanently.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These in-app deletion tools are designed to offer flexibility while
      ensuring your content can be removed quickly and securely without
      affecting your overall account.
